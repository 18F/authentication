We have developed several [HMAC](..) libraries in
parallel across the most common languages in use at 18F:

- Go: [github.com/18F/hmacauth](https://github.com/18F/hmacauth/)
- Node (npm):
  [hmac-authentication](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hmac-authentication)
- Ruby (RubyGem):
  [hmac_authentication](https://rubygems.org/gems/hmac_authentication)
- Python (PyPI):
  [hmac_authentication](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hmac_authentication/)

Each of the package pages contains illustrations of its common use. (_Note:
This isn't entirely true of every implementation at the moment, but it will
be._)
